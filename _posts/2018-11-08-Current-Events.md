## dez bryant injury

When Dez Bryant suffered a torn Achilles on the last play of practice Friday, he lost his opportunity to play for a contender, reach a Super Bowl, and make himself even more valuable during free agency this winter -- all part of his grand plan when he signed with the New Orleans Saints.

The season-ending injury will cost Bryant money next offseason. No team is expected to pay Bryant what he was hoping to make, though it's possible he can land an incentive-laden deal that would boost his value if he returns strong from the injury.


The person that commited this mass murder was a Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan. The veteran took his 
own life after being confronted by the police. He used a handgun that he purchased illegal but did an illegal act with it.
